    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a simple and easy recipe that tastes great to those that love
      tuna. It's an omelette (or multiple omelettes to be more accurate) with a
      single ingredient, tuna, where the mix of flavours gives it its unique
      taste. Pd: We call it "tortillas de atún", so it's not exactly an
      omelette, but it's the word that I found the most fitting for the recipe.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
      <li>1 medium can of tuna</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Break the eggs into a bowl where you can mix them</li>
      <li>Add salt to the eggs</li>
      <li>Whisk them until you have a foam like consistency</li>
      <li>
        In a medium temperature pan (with oil), carefully add two tablespoons of
        the eggs into it
      </li>
      <li>Add tuna on top of the eggs that you placed on the pan</li>
      <li>
        Cover the top with one tablespoon of eggs (add another if it's not
        covered yet)
      </li>
      <li>After 3-5 minutes, carefully turn it around</li>
      <li>
        After 1-3 minutes, remove it from the pan, and there you have your first
        tuna omelette
      </li>
      <li>Repeat the process until you have no more eggs in the bowl</li>
    </ol>
