    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe is a variation of a traditional korean breakfast that I found
      via youtube. It has more ingredients than the original but it's still as
      simple and delicious as that one.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sesame oil</li>
      <li>Soy sauce</li>
      <li>Two large eggs</li>
      <li>Cooked white rice</li>
      <li>Momofuku chili crunch</li>
      <li>Turkey breast ham</li>
      <li>Green onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut green onion and ham into little squares</li>
      <li>
        Add sesame oil to a pan and wait until it's hot enough (set the pan to
        medium heat)
      </li>
      <li>Add two eggs without breaking their yolk</li>
      <li>Carefully separate the egg white from the yolk and cook it</li>
      <li>
        When the egg white is cooked, add a tablespoon of sesame oil on the eggs
      </li>
      <li>Add a table spoon of soy sauce over the eggs</li>
      <li>Break the egg yolks and mix everything together</li>
      <li>Add the ham and mix (You can turn off the heat by this moment)</li>
      <li>
        When cooked (be careful not to dry the eggs), add it to a bowl with rice
      </li>
      <li>Add the green onion you sliced on top of the eggs</li>
      <li>Add a teaspoon of momofuku and mix together</li>
    </ol>

      As I mentioned, I learned about the recipe via youtube, and modified it
      through time. Here's a link to these videos: The first one it's on a
      chanel called
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MBnJsEbDflA">Chef Chris Cho</a>
      and the other one is called
      <a href="https://youtu.be/N13D0yO5xm0?si=Tm3QqrfZBDY1Qv-b"
